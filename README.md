#T2T #Creational Design Patterns in Java

This project demonstrates five key creational patterns:
1. Singleton – Ensures only one instance exists (Logger)
2. Factory Method – Creates objects without exposing instantiation logic (Shapes)
3. Builder – Step-by-step object construction (Computer)
4. Prototype – Clone existing objects (Document)
5. Abstract Factory – Create related families of objects (UI Themes)
